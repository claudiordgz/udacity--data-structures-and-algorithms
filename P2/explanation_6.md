# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

Bonus Challenge: Is it possible to find the max and min in a single traversal?

Sorting usually requires O(n log n) time Can you come up with a O(n) algorithm (i.e., linear time)?
